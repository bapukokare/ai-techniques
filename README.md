A curated list of AI tools and techniques to solve problems. No background knowledge assumed.
 
Here AI is an umbrella term for anything that has to do with learning and/or data, including techniques from Statistics, Data Science, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Artificial General Intelligence and related fields.
 
The goal is to let you know that these tools exist, giving a basic usage example, resources and weaknesses.

### Neural Network Classifier (Supervised Learning, Deep Learning)
*Superpower*: Classify objects in images, text, video and more.
*How hard*: Medium. Popular defaults are good enough to get far, the bottleneck is getting good data, but debugging is tricky.  
*Libraries*: Pytorch, Detectron2 
*Example*: [Vision classifier on CIFAR10 dataset](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/blitz/cifar10_tutorial.html) 
*Weak Points*: Needs a lot of labelled data to be highly accurate, hard to interpret, hard to quantify prediction confidence.
*Other*: Top choice for high level concepts such as "cat vs dog" given an image.



### Decision Trees (Supervised Learning)
*Superpower*: Classification and regression with little data preparation.
*How hard*: Easy
*Libraries*: Sklearn
*Example*: [Decision Trees with Sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/tree.html) 
*Weak Points*: Tend to overfit or be unstable, limited learning capabilities. 
*Other*: Great explainability (can be mapped to yes/no questions), great for tabular data.
